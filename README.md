# Project: Data Preprocessing on Life Expectancy Dataset

## Overview
This project preprocesses the Life Expectancy dataset to prepare it for analysis and predictive modeling. The preprocessing includes cleaning, encoding, and normalizing data to ensure it is ready for machine learning algorithms.The aim is to uncover isights into the trends, distributions, correlations and outliers through visualizations

## Objective
- To clean and preprocess the Life Expectancy dataset for accurate analysis and predictive modeling.

## Dataset Description
The Life Expectancy dataset contains information on life expectancy and various health indicators across different countries from 2000 to 2015.

## Key Activities
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers.
2. **Feature Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into numerical format.
3. **Normalization**: Scaling the data to ensure uniformity across features.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding the data through visualizations and statistics.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing library.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for data preprocessing.

## Key Insights
- **Correlation**: There is a strong positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy.
- **Outliers**: Identified and handled outliers in the dataset to improve data quality.
- **Missing Values**: Applied various imputation techniques to handle missing data, ensuring no significant information loss.
- **Health Indicators**: Observed significant trends in health indicators like schooling, alcohol consumption, and adult mortality in relation to life expectancy.

## Additional Points
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for creating insightful visualizations.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for predictive modeling.
- **Imputation Techniques**: Applying strategies to fill missing data.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examining relationships between different features.
- **Exporting Cleaned Data**: Saving the preprocessed data for further use in analysis and machine learning models.
